## Introduction

**PostgreSQL**, often referred to as **Postgres**, has been in active development since 1989 and has evolved into one of the most robust relational database management systems available today. Known for its **ACID compliance** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), it ensures the reliability and integrity of your data. Its advanced features like **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)**, **triggers**, **foreign keys**, and **stored procedures** make PostgreSQL a top choice for a wide range of applications, from small web apps to large enterprise systems.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide **walks you through** the essentials of PostgreSQL, from installation to advanced database management techniques.

## Key Features

PostgreSQL offers numerous features that make it stand out as a leading database management system:

- **ACID Compliance**: Guarantees data reliability and consistency in all transactions.
- **JSON Support**: Offers robust support for handling JSON data, allowing for hybrid relational/NoSQL models.
- **High Performance & Scalability**: Optimized for speed, handling complex queries efficiently, even under heavy load.
- **Security**: Provides secure authentication methods, encryption, and access control for data protection.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute under the PostgreSQL license.
- **Replication & Clustering**: Supports replication for high availability and horizontal scaling.
